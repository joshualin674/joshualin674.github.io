This website functions as a holistic representation of my mind and its artistic process, and thus, its title being "the website version of myself." The design marries a child-like, whimsical aesthetic with a structured monochromatic color palette, reflective of my approach to creation: a blend of carefree spontaneity and intentional/structured design. The site is divided into pages showcasing my art, me, and my sources of inspiration, capturing the three essential stages of the creative process: the work itself, the creator behind it, and the media that the creator consumes. Together, these different pages provide a multifaceted portrayal of me as a creator from a singular source.
